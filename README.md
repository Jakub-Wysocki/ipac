# About
Simple program that from IPv4 address counts subnet mask, network address and range of hosts. It rely only on standard C/C++ library.
# Status
This is a side project I made while learning programming. I am not developing it anymore. When I look at it today, the quality of the code, project structure and overall problem solutions are rather bad.
